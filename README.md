# Title of the Project

This project simulates a realistic public health scenario where a governance body must allocate a limited supply of vaccines during a crisis, using only observational data generated by a biased historical rollout. I replicated California state's population with age, comorbidities, exposure risk, socioeconomic status, and other factors, then simulate a non-random logging policy that vaccinates high-risk individuals more often introducing confounding similar to real-world healthcare data. The aim of the project is to evaluate new vaccine allocation strategies with causal off-policy methods such as Inverse Propensity Weighting and Doubly Robust estimation, compare their estimated effectiveness, and quantify uncertainity through confidence Intervals and regret analysis.
