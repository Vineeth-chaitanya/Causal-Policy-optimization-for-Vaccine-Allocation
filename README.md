# Title of the Project


## Overview
This project simulates a realistic public health scenario where a governance body must allocate a limited supply of vaccines during a crisis, using only observational data generated by a biased historical rollout. I replicated California state's population with age, comorbidities, exposure risk, socioeconomic status, and other factors, then simulate a non-random logging policy that vaccinates high-risk individuals more often introducing confounding similar to real-world healthcare data. The aim of the project is to evaluate new vaccine allocation strategies with causal off-policy methods such as **Inverse Propensity Weighting** and **Doubly Robust estimation**, compare their estimated effectiveness, and quantify uncertainity through confidence Intervals and regret analysis.

## Key Features

I have generated synthetic data replicating ***California*** states demographics. This data contains following attributes:  
- **age** — age of each individual  
- **county** — name of the county  
- **county_code** — numeric county code  
- **household_id** — unique ID assigned to each household  
- **household_size** — number of persons in a single household (living together)
- **household_type** — represents different age groups in the household
- **multigenerational** — represents if there are any elderly persons in the household
- **occupation** — occupation of the person
- **frontline_worker** — binary column representing if a person is frontline_worker
- **daily_activity_level** — representing three levels of activity (low/moderate/high)
- **has_asthma** — Boolean column representing if a person has asthma
- **has_copd_or_chronic_resp_disease** — Boolean column representing if a person has Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
- **has_other_respiratory_issue** — if person has any other respiratory issue(Boolean column)
- **has_hypertension** — has hypertension? (directly related to heart attack/stroke/kidney disease)
- **has_heart_disease** — has any heart disease?
- **has_stroke_history** — has any stroke history?
- **has_diabetes** — has diabetes or not
- **has_obesity** — has obesity or not
- **has_smoking_history** — smoking history if any
- **ses_quintile** — Socio economic status (into 5 different categories)
- **is_long_term_care** — is in active long term care?
